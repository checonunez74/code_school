// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 4.8 To the Lighthouse, Quick!
// -----------------------------

// Build a declared function that adds the following three rangers, in order and 
// as complete objects, to the Lighthouse Rock object itself:

//   name: “Nick Walsh”, skillz: “magnification burn”, station: 2
//   name: “Drew Barontini”, skillz: “uppercut launch”, station: 3
//   name: “Christine Wong”, skillz: “bomb defusing”, station: 1

// Each added ranger object should become its own property within lighthouseRock, 
// specifically ranger1, ranger2, and ranger3. Additionally, as you add a ranger, 
// increment the number of rangers present using the existing numRangers property.

// In order to add your newly created objects to the Lighthouse, your function 
// should accept a location parameter, which will represent that object. To help 
// us check your function, order your function parameters as location, name, 
// skillz, and station.

// Name your new function addRanger. Lastly, when the function has been built, 
// call it three times, with the appropriate data each time, to effectively add 
// all three rangers to lighthouseRock.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 4.9 Man your Bulb Stations!
// ---------------------------

// Build a function that takes in a location object, examines every ranger’s 
// station number, and retrieves the name of the super-blinder to which they’re 
// assigned from the array of the super-blinders. When the right super-blinder 
// is found for a ranger-dev, alert it in a message to the ranger in the following 
// format:

//   Avast, me hearties!
//   There be Pirates nearby! Stations!
//   <name>, man the <superblinder>!
//   <name>, man the <superblinder>!
//   <name>, man the <superblinder>!

// Call your function dontPanic, and when it is completed, call it on the 
// lighthouseRock variable which is provided for you, complete with new 
// ranger-dev objects as if they had been there from the get-go.
